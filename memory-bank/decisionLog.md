# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|

[2026-04-24 07:04:50] - **ADR-01: Repo and package name `oida-code`, NOT `unslop.ai`.**
**Why:** `infos.md` §1 documented active collisions for `unslop` (github.com/mshumer/unslop, unslop.xyz, unslop.design, unslopsearch.com, theunslop.app, Unslop Code Cleaner on MCP Market, anti-slop skill on Smithery). The brand is saturated and the "anti-slop" framing conflicts with the OIDA-for-code positioning (blueprint §1). User confirmed public repo creation as `yannabadie/oida-code` on 2026-04-23.
**Applies to:** package name (`oida-code` on PyPI, `oida_code` in Python), CLI binary (`oida-code`), GitHub repo, documentation.

[2026-04-24 07:04:50] - **ADR-02: Reuse the existing OIDA core verbatim via vendoring.**
**Why:** Blueprint §2 is explicit: "Keep the current OIDA core almost intact". The vendored package (`search/OIDA/oida_framework/oida/*.py`) already implements `grounding`, `Q_obs`, `μ`, `λ_bias`, `N_eff`, `Debt`, `V_dur`, `H_sys`, `V_net`, pattern state machine, and `double_loop_repair`. Reimplementing would risk formula drift and violate the plan rule "Reuse over rewrite" (prompt.md operating rules).
**How applied:** Files copied verbatim to `src/oida_code/_vendor/oida_framework/`. SHA256 of each file pinned in `VENDORED_FROM.txt`. `ruff` and `mypy --strict` exclude `_vendor/**` via `pyproject.toml`. `score/analyzer.py` is a thin re-export shim.

[2026-04-24 07:04:50] - **ADR-03: Python-only for v0.**
**Why:** Blueprint §4. The user's existing codebase is Python; Hypothesis + mutmut give a strong verification wedge quickly; Semgrep and CodeQL both support Python as a first-class language. Adding JS/TS/Go/Rust before the wedge is proven would dilute focus.
**How applied:** `pyproject.toml requires-python = ">=3.11"`; `ingest/manifest.default_python_commands` is the only language-aware helper shipped; `inspect` hard-codes `language = "python"` in the emitted `AuditRequest`.

[2026-04-24 07:04:50] - **ADR-04: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B as default local verifier.**
**Why:** Blueprint §10. Open-weight (Apache 2.0), official `transformers serve` + `llama.cpp` GGUF support, designed for agentic coding / repo-level reasoning. On the user's RTX 3500 Ada Laptop (12 GB VRAM), the MoE architecture (35B total, 3B active per token) makes Q4_K_M (~20 GB) tractable via partial offload at 20-30 tok/s. A smaller fallback model will handle extraction / cheap classification.
**Status:** Decision recorded; zero implementation in phase 1 (no LLM code shipped). Implementation begins phase 3 (blueprint §13 day 9).

[2026-04-24 07:04:50] - **ADR-05: CLI-first, GitHub Action second, SaaS last.**
**Why:** Blueprint §4 deployment modes ordered: (1) `oida-code audit ./repo`, (2) GitHub Action (local / self-hosted), (3) GitHub App + SaaS. A CLI is trivially testable locally, has no hosting dependencies, and is what power users want first. GitHub Action adds CI integration without servers. SaaS adds auth / billing / multi-tenancy — all orthogonal to the core wedge.
**How applied:** Phase 1 ships only the CLI entry point (`oida-code = oida_code.cli:app`). `src/oida_code/github/checks.py` and `annotations.py` exist as stubs but raise `NotImplementedError`.

[2026-04-24 07:04:50] - **ADR-06: Typer over Click or argparse for the new CLI.**
**Why:** Typer's `Annotated[T, typer.Option(...)]` style is mypy-strict-clean, produces rich Rich-rendered help, and has first-class subcommand ergonomics for the planned `inspect / normalize / verify / audit / repair` surface. argparse would work but loses type-safety on options; Click would require more boilerplate. Vendored `oida` CLI keeps argparse (untouched per ADR-02).
**Cost:** +1 dep (`typer>=0.12`) and its `rich` transitive.

[2026-04-24 07:04:50] - **ADR-07: Pydantic v2 at the public boundary; dataclasses in the vendored core.**
**Why:** Blueprint §5 shows JSON-first schemas with strict validation semantics. Pydantic v2 gives `ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` for airtight APIs, deterministic `model_dump_json(indent=2)`, and is the community default for Python typed I/O. The vendored core uses `@dataclass(slots=True)` and must not be touched (ADR-02). A mapper bridges the two surfaces — phase 2.

[2026-04-24 07:04:50] - **ADR-08: `--base HEAD` accepted as a valid (empty-diff) inspect target.**
**Why:** Gate 4 of prompt.md Step 3 requires `oida-code inspect ./search/OIDA/oida_framework --base HEAD` to produce a valid `AuditRequest` JSON. After `git init`, the whole workspace is a single commit; `HEAD..HEAD` is an empty diff. Rather than staging a synthetic two-commit setup, the implementation treats `base == head` as "empty changed_files list" — still a deserializable `AuditRequest`. Real usage is always `--base origin/main` or similar.

[2026-04-24 07:04:50] - **ADR-09: Typer callback uses `invoke_without_command=True`.**
**Why:** Required so that `oida-code --version` exits 0 without Typer complaining "Missing command." Without this flag, the subcommand-required check runs before the version callback's `typer.Exit(code=0)`.
**Discovered:** empirically, fixing `tests/test_cli_smoke.py::test_version_flag`.

[2026-04-24 07:45:00] - **ADR-10: `PLAN.md` is the active plan; blueprint §11 is superseded; `roadmap.md` is subsumed.**
**Why:** The user authored `roadmap.md` post-Step-0 with an 8-phase realistic schedule (12-14 weeks) that refines the blueprint's aspirational 10-day plan (§11). The two documents are compatible: blueprint is the architectural spec + formulas (§1-10, §12-13), roadmap is the phasing + observation model + Explore/Exploit integration. A merged single source of truth prevents drift.
**How applied:** Created `PLAN.md` merging both. New authority order: `PLAN.md > blueprint §1-10 §12-13 > roadmap > brainstorm2_improved > last > infos > brainstorm2`. Blueprint §11 "First 10 implementation days" explicitly superseded by `PLAN.md` §14. What was called "phase 1 bootstrap" in `PHASE1_REPORT.md` maps to `PLAN.md` Phase 0 (complete). Verdict labels finalized as machine identifiers: `verified / counterexample_found / insufficient_evidence / corrupt_success`.

[2026-04-24 07:45:00] - **ADR-11: Observation model + obligation graph become first-class schema surface (Phase 2).**
**Why:** Roadmap P2 (the "keystone" phase per the document) posits that Explore/Exploit cannot map cleanly to code without an explicit `Obligation` / `ProgressEvent` / `NoProgressSegment` triple. Without these, the bridge from grid→codebase is "an intuition, not a validated component" (roadmap ¶ on the hard point). The observation model is therefore promoted from "phase 2 extract/* stubs" to a dedicated `models/trace.py` + `models/obligation.py` + `models/progress_event.py` triple shipping in Phase 2.
**How applied:** `PLAN.md` §8 defines the three types formally; `PLAN.md` §9 tracks them as schema v2; `extract/obligation_graph.py` becomes a new first-class module. Phase 2 exit gate requires a 50-100 hand-annotated trace dataset.

[2026-04-24 16:30:00] - **ADR-15: Phase 2 exit criterion downgraded; classification + recall gate moved to Phase 3.**
**Why:** Per advisor pre-start review, the original Phase 2 exit criterion ("describe action-by-action where an agent explores / exploits / stagnates / loops") is Explore/Exploit classification logic — which PLAN.md §14 explicitly assigns to Phase 3. Additionally, the "60% obligation-extraction recall on hand-annotated set" metric is meaningful only on independently-labeled PRs; a 5-10-scenario synthetic dataset hits 100% recall by construction because ground truth IS what I wrote. So the synthetic dataset serves as a shape smoke-test, not as a recall gate.
**How applied:** `PLAN.md` §14 P2 row updated. New P2 exit criterion: schema v2 stable + `NormalizedScenario` round-trips through `OIDAAnalyzer` + obligation extractor runs without crash + non-empty obligations with unique IDs + 10-repo smoke (crash/no-crash table). Also capped obligation kinds at **3 implemented** (migration / precondition / api_contract) + 3 stubbed (invariant / security_rule / observability). Real classification + recall = Phase 3.

[2026-04-24 14:30:00] - **ADR-13: ``ReportSummary`` fusion fields are ``Optional[float]`` in v1.1; Phase 1 emits ``null``.**
**Why:** Advisor review flagged three options for fields that require the OIDA fusion (``mean_q_obs``, ``mean_grounding``, ``total_v_net``, ``debt_final``, ``corrupt_success_ratio``): (a) ``Optional[float] = None``, (b) a separate ``evidence_only_summary`` block, (c) emit ``0.0`` with a footnote. Option (c) is the trap — a reader who skims debt=0.0 concludes "no debt", which is a silent lie. Option (b) doubles the schema surface. Option (a) is the honest choice: the field is populated in Phase 5 when fusion lands; until then it is ``null``. Markdown render treats ``null`` as "not computed in Phase 1" so the human reader sees the gap.
**How applied:** `src/oida_code/models/audit_report.py` has ``Optional[float]`` on all fusion metrics. `src/oida_code/report/markdown_report.py` renders ``null`` as "_not computed in Phase 1_". Phase-1 deterministic verdict resolver never sets these fields.

[2026-04-24 14:30:00] - **ADR-14: ``verify`` CLI consumes ``AuditRequest`` (not ``NormalizedScenario``) in Phase 1; schema bridge deferred to Phase 2.**
**Why:** Blueprint §8 specifies ``oida-code verify .oida/scenario.json`` — the scenario is produced by ``normalize``, which is a Phase 2 concern (needs the obligation graph). Rather than stub verify until Phase 2, Phase 1 has verify accept ``AuditRequest`` directly because every Phase-1 deterministic verifier (ruff / mypy / pytest / semgrep / codeql) works on raw repo state, not on normalized events. When Phase 2 lands, verify will gain a content-type sniff to accept either shape.
**How applied:** `src/oida_code/cli.py verify_cmd` loads `AuditRequest`. The Phase 2 plan entry in `progress.md` explicitly lists "verify learns to accept NormalizedScenario too".

[2026-04-24 07:45:00] - **ADR-12: Hardware treated as prototyping station; production-inference ADR deferred.**
**Why:** Roadmap P0 explicitly flags: "R&D locale oui, vrai SaaS non" given RTX 3500 Ada Laptop (12 GB VRAM, 432 GB/s) vs Qwen3.6 model-card serving examples (tp-size 8). ADR-04 (default local Qwen3.6-35B-A3B) still holds for phase-4 development, but this ADR acknowledges that multi-tenant inference needs either managed API (Anthropic / OpenAI) or dedicated cloud GPU. Decision on that path is deferred to post-wedge validation (after Phase 5 shows real signal).
**How applied:** `PLAN.md` §13 spells out the development-vs-production split. `infos.md` §3 (M.2 2 TB upgrade) now explicitly gates Phase 4.
